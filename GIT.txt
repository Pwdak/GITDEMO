How To connect your local repository to a hosted repository on GitHub, 
you generally need to follow these steps:

1. **Create a Repository on GitHub:**
   Start by creating a new repository on GitHub where you want to host your project.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command in your terminal:
   
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```  
   Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.

3. **Navigate to Your Local Repository:**
   Move into the newly cloned repository's directory using the `cd` command in your terminal:
   
   ```bash
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

4. **Connect Local Repository to Remote GitHub Repository:**
   By default, your local repository is connected to the remote repository on GitHub you cloned it from. 
   However, if you want to connect it explicitly, you can use the following command:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin <repository_url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.

5. **Push Local Changes to GitHub:**
   Make changes to your local repository as needed. When you want to push these changes to 
   the remote GitHub repository, use the following commands:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message here"
   git push origin <branch_name>
   ```
   Replace `<branch_name>` with the name of the branch you're working on (usually "main" or "master").

6. **Pull Changes from GitHub:**
   If you or others make changes to the remote repository, you can pull those changes to 
   your local repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git pull origin <branch_name>
   ```

7. **Creating New Branches:**
   You can create new branches in your local repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <new_branch_name>
   ```
   This will create and switch to the new branch.

8. **Pushing and Pulling on Other Branches:**
   When working on branches other than the default one, make sure to use 
   the appropriate branch name when pushing and pulling:

   ```bash
   git push origin <branch_name>
   git pull origin <branch_name>
   ```

These are the basic steps to connect your local repository to a hosted repository on GitHub.
